Instructions
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
"""

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
"""
import random

total_people = len(names)
who_pays = random.randint(0,total_people-1)
print(names[who_pays] +" will pay today :)")
"""
import random
num_items = len(names)
random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items-1)
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]
print(person_who_will_pay+" is the person who will pay")
